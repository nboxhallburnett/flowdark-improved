Flowdark Improved
=======

For some reason a lot of the default colours for the built-in `flowdark` skin for [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/) are very hard to read, such as links and quotes.

This repo contains my personal overrides for the `flowdark` theme that makes it usable.

### Instructions for use
#### MacOS:
Copy the `userstyle.css` file to:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Flowdock/
```

#### Windows
Copy the `userstyle.css` file to:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\flowdock-desktop-win\
```
